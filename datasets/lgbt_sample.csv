1752293922,">>40360946 Ok, so probably a solid chance you gravitate to female abuse because it was less bad than the male stuff hence it’s become glorified. Could even have contributed to transitioning. The good news is there’s hope for you if headpats still feel good. You need to find a woman with some mild mommy energy without actually crossing the line into being a look alike, that will ruin it. I’m talking taller than you and fat. Subconsciously they will be a role filler. Eventually you’ll need a supportive male friend, but that will come last, do not fear. More importantly you need a completely open non judgmental sweetheart. Someone who literally cannot bring themselves to lie to you. Someone who won’t judge you for your past and your strange fetishes. It will take months, at least 6, but you will slowly bit by bit realize that the betrayal or hurt isn’t coming. That the love is real. That the safety is real. You can actually feel trust again. You will know the day the dam breaks because of how emotional you will get, but it will happen. Once you’ve passed that threshold you can work to getting healthy again, maybe slowly after another year or two of safety with wifey she can help you find some more friends she’s vetted as safe. Ironically, to gain control you need to find someone you can let go around, because otherwise you will find yourself fighting constantly and that is terrible for the brain. It will be a slow process, you will have to observe them for many months…but they exist.

Extinction denies that, and it's a permanent fate that affects entire groups based on cascading failures that are generally very hard to reverse and involve a long decline. It can also involve the victory of an Other and tends to occur with rapid change... the stress from that change has sadistic appeal. >technological unemployment Like cuckolding but skill based instead of sexual, humans are social animals so a lot of our worth derives from appraisal of our functions in an interdependent sense. Being made redundant strips that away while inducing despair, and empowers smaller groups of already selfish and powerful people. Also machines are just really sexy - they have messy internal parts with a harmonic order overall and can excel at specialized functions absurdly well. >genocide Generally involves rape and snuff... like the aforementioned mass extinction but with more conscious humiliation element that may be recorded in history for a long time. >stats and measurements It's intimate knowledge.

Sorry to hit you with the cold water here but virginity isn't -that- big of a deal but it is a spiritual thing more than it is physical, otherwise you wouldn't feel so left out on it. When your friends talk about sex, what are you going to tell them? ''oh I uhhh, paid someone $300 to fuck me haha'', or will you lie and dig a hole making up a bf/gf / fwb scenario that nobody knows and nobody will come to believe exists. If you're going to lie about it whats even the point of paying for it? I've had cis male friends drop that bomb on me several times, its depressing how normalized that mindset is. You would get more respect finding a guy / girl at the bar to pity fuck you one night, at least you earned it being going outside and actually being social. People who pay to ''lose'' their virginity are still mentally virgins who will never fix whats wrong with them to get real ass. They will never be able to reciprocate an actual intimate moment. All they know how to do is punch in and punch out, its a hollow transactional experience you will learn nothing from anon.
